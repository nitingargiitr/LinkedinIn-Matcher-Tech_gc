## Project Summary: Persona to LinkedIn Profile Matcher

### Problem Scope

The task of persona-to-LinkedIn profile matching involves several core technical challenges:

- **Unstructured Input**: Persona data is often freeform and inconsistently formatted, requiring parsing to extract structured fields.
- **Sparse Data**: Critical information like job title, company name, or location may be implied or missing entirely.
- **Multi-Modal Verification**: Reliable identity verification requires both textual and visual (face image) matching.

### Solution Pipeline

#### 1. Input Preprocessing

- Parses varied JSON input formats into a standardized schema.
- Handles missing or optional fields like timezone or profile image using default fallbacks.
- Normalizes and cleans input (e.g., lowercasing, whitespace removal) for consistent downstream processing.

#### 2. Data Enrichment

- **Title Extraction**: Extracts professional roles (e.g., CEO, Engineer) from introductions using POS tagging and rule-based patterns.
- **Company Name Detection**: Identifies company names using contextual patterns like “founder of” or “working at”.
- **Skill Extraction**: Derives key technical and soft skills from descriptive text.
- **Location Detection**: Infers location from timezone, intro text, or known place references.
- **Link Parsing**: Detects and stores relevant URLs (GitHub, Twitter, personal websites).

#### 3. NLP Pipeline

- Utilizes **spaCy** for:
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract names, organizations, locations.
  - POS tagging to assist in role and skill extraction.
- Regular expressions are used for structured pattern extraction (URLs, emails, titles).

#### 4. Face Matching

- Leverages **DeepFace** for image embedding generation and cosine similarity scoring.
- Match strength is categorized as:
  - High confidence: score ≥ 0.8
  - Moderate confidence: score between 0.6 and 0.8
  - Low confidence: score < 0.6
- This layer adds visual verification to distinguish profiles with similar textual content.

#### 5. Verification and Ranking

- A weighted scoring system is applied:
  - Name similarity (50%)
  - Company and role (20%)
  - Industry and company size (15%)
  - Location (10%)
  - Social media presence (5%)
- Confidence penalties are applied for missing fields to avoid overconfident matches.
- Matches are ranked by total confidence score, optionally adjusted using face similarity.
